Hi and welcome in to 11ty gets tufte project.

{% notesimage "2s", "/img/11ty-gets-tufte.svg" , "11ty gets tufte" , "11ty gets tufte - Free and open source code"%}

An 11ty project based on the work of [Edward Tufte](https://edwardtufte.com). This 11ty project uses [tufte-css](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) and [et-book, a web typeface of the font used in Edward Tufte's books](https://github.com/edwardtufte/et-book). The failover font is Gil Sans which is also a prefered font of Edward Tufte. Thank you Dave Liepman the creator of `tufte.css` and to all of the contributors to [Tufte-CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css).

This 11ty port is maintained and developed by [Adam DJ Brett](https://www.adamdjbrett.com) to help you build a book site easily and quickly!!!

I admire not only Tufte's work but also `tufte.css` because of their simplicity, sidenotes, typography, and  multiple types of images that can be used.
